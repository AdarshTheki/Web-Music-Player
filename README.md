# Spotify Clone Project Plan

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for my Spotify clone project. In this project, I aim to recreate the core features of the Spotify music streaming service using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Fetch API.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication

- [ ] Implement user registration and login functionality.
- [ ] Securely store user credentials.
- [ ] Allow users to reset their passwords.

### 2. Music Playback

- [ ] Fetch and display a list of songs from a music database (e.g., Spotify's API).
- [ ] Allow users to play, pause, and skip songs.
- [ ] Display the current song's title, artist, and album artwork.

### 3. Playlists and Favorites

- [ ] Enable users to create, edit, and delete playlists.
- [ ] Allow users to add songs to their playlists.
- [ ] Implement a "favorites" feature to save favorite songs.

### 4. Search Functionality

- [ ] Implement a search bar to look up songs, artists, and albums.
- [ ] Display search results with relevant information.

### 5. User Profile

- [ ] Create user profiles with user information and profile pictures.
- [ ] Allow users to edit their profiles.

### 6. Responsive Design

- [ ] Ensure that the website is responsive and works well on various devices and screen sizes.

### 7. Music Recommendation

- [ ] Implement a recommendation system to suggest songs based on user preferences.

### 8. Music Player Controls

- [ ] Add volume control and a progress bar for song playback.
- [ ] Display playback time and allow users to seek within songs.

### 9. Notifications

- [ ] Implement notifications for user actions (e.g., adding songs to playlists).

### 10. Error Handling

- [ ] Provide meaningful error messages and handle edge cases gracefully.

## Components

- [ ] Create reusable components for the user interface, such as header, footer, and music player components.
- [ ] Separate the application into logical modules for improved maintainability.

## Data Fetching

- [ ] Utilize the Fetch API to retrieve data from a music database or API.
- [ ] Handle API requests and responses effectively.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Fetch API

## Tools

- [ ] Choose a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
- [ ] Set up version control using Git and GitHub.
- [ ] Host the project on a web hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

## Next Steps

- [ ] Start by setting up the project structure and creating the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- [ ] Implement user authentication and user profile features.
- [ ] Begin working on the music playback functionality and user interface.
- [ ] Continuously test and improve the application as you add new features.
